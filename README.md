# anime-radiostation
A web application for an anime radio station, based on LISTEN.moe. It plays a raw audio stream on the site and connects to LISTEN.moe's WebSocket to retrieve data about the current song playing, artist for that song and the song duration. The last one mentioned is used to calculate how much of a song has played and is displayed in form of a progress bar.

Currently doesn't work on iPhone (and I suspect other smartphones are a no-go as well). The play/pause button is bugged there + no audio plays when you press play.
